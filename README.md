# PyBer_Analysis
## A ride-sharing by city type Analysis

### Overview of the analysis: 

The general objective of the analysis is to provide information for decision-makers to improving access to shared transport services and determining the affordability of access for disadvantaged neighborhoods.
We have been asked to analyze the differences in total weekly rates for each type of city. For this we need to manipulate the data provided to obtain the information by city type and then carry out the necessary operations to obtain the totals and averages that will serve us to make comparisons and make conclusions.

### Results:

As mentioned above, the following table was generated that allows us to make a deeper analysis of the information we have. 

#### Table 1:

It can be seen that the PyBer market covers 3 types of cities: Rural, Suburban and Urban. As expected, the total number of rides, as well as the total number of drivers, is lower in rural areas than in Urban and Suburban areas.
Specifically, the total number of rides in rural areas is approximately 5 times less than in Suburban areas and 13 times less than in Urban areas.
While the Total drivers in rural areas is 6 times less than Suburban cities and 30 times less than Urban areas.
The foregoing can probably be explained because in Rural cities there is less access to said service likely due to limited access to the application that provides the service or that motor transport and the public service are the most demanded.
As a result of the above and as a response to the behavior of the market, there are higher fares both per trip and per driver in Rural cities compared to Suburban and Urban cities.
Despite the high fares present in Rural cities, their participation in the Total Fair is still very poor as can be seen in the graph below.

This behavior opens windows of opportunity for the company if it is known how to deal with it. For this, it is necessary to reflect on the disparities in access to services that require a certain degree of digitization and internet access of the population between different types of cities, also highlighting the price inequality in the Pyber service that leaves out the lower-income populations across social classes.
It is very important to evaluate the reason for the low demand for the PyBer service in rural cities in order to generate a strategic proposal that is useful for these cities, the response that we can obtain by carrying out a market study (marked analysis) focused on said population.

Based on the results, we can make the following recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

* The first is to carry out a market study focused on Rural communities, to assess the level of income, the main use of transport, the level of digital access, the interest in the PyBer service, among others.

* With the information obtained, it will be possible to evaluate maintaining or lowering the Fare so that the PyBer service will be attractive for rural communities.

* If the reason why the service is not demanded is because it is not essential for said communities, it could be evaluated adding to the company's service provision scheme a type focused on the demands of the transport service of said communities.
